# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Frida!

I'm currently learning the basics of **Web Development** â€” exploring how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to build something simple yet interactive.

This project is one of my practice works to understand how to structure and design a website from scratch.  
Still a work in progress, but every line of code is a step forward! ðŸš€  

ðŸ’¡ **What I'm learning:**
- Structuring pages with HTML  
- Styling and color harmony with CSS  
- Adding interactivity using JavaScript  

ðŸ“‚ **Project Repository:**

âœ¨ *Still learning, still building.*  
Letâ€™s grow and create something amazing together!
